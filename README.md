# PHYS231Lab

Physics laboratory to demonstrate behavior of quantum particles in three 2-dimensional settings through numerical methods. 
The three settings: infinite square well, finite square well, and harmonic oscillator. 

# ISW

Infinite square well: a particle trapped in a well of energy where walls have infinite energy

# FSW

Finite square well: a particle trapped in a well of finite energy walls

# hrmOsc

Harmonic oscillator: a particle trapped in a well shaped like a parabola.
